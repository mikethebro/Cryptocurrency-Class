## Cryptographic Hash Functions
-mathematical function  
-takes any string as input  
-fixed-size output (we'll use 256 bits)  
-efficiently computable  
### Security properties
#### Collision-Free  
-Nobody can find x and y such that x != y and H(x)=H(y)  
-collisions may exist, just ensure nobody can find them
#### hiding  
#### puzzle-friendly
